Homework 6

### WeatherPy Observations
* There was a poor to no correlation of cloudiness and the latitude coordinates in either hemisphere. This was determined by the low r-squared value in the regression model.
* There was a visiable correlation in the tempurature in either direction and the latitude coordinates. This was determined by the high r-squared value in the regression model.

### VacationPy Maps

* The maps were not displaying in my jupyter lab. I tried to run jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps with no success. I did my best with the code not being able to check the results.
